### The different quality cuts to apply
Qualities:
    # <label>: <cut>
    # label is the string inserted in histogram and plot names
    # cut is the value of the cut to apply.
    # To select all the qualities, set the cut to -1.
    qualAll: -1
    qualDouble:  8
    qualSingle: 12
RecoToL1PtCutFactor: 1.2
### The different of regions of eta
Regions:
    # <label>: [<low bound>, <high bound>]
    # label is the string inserted in histogram and plot names
    # low bound is the lowest value of abs(eta) for that region (inclusive)
    # high bound is the highest value of abs(eta) for that region (exclusive)
    BMTF: [0.0, 0.83]
    OMTF: [0.83, 1.24]
    EMTF: [1.24, 2.4]
    AllEta: [0.0, 2.4]
### The thresholds to draw the turn-on of
# Thresholds: [<thr 1>, <thr 2>, ...]
# thr # are the different threshold values (in GeV) to use
Thresholds: [7, 15, 22]
### These are some boolean fields to select to compute and draw some plots or not
#   these fields need to exist, and must be set to either true or false.
